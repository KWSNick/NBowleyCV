# Nick Bowley Resume

## README

## Introduction

---

This site was created as an alternative to a typical Curriculum Vitae. The intent was to also showcase Full Stack Developer skills by creating a product using the skills an employer might disire.

The main objectives of the site are to increase the chances of employment and be a more attractive candidate to potential employers.

## UX

---
It was identified that traditional methods of promoting yourself (CV, Covering Letter, LinkedIn, Application Form) 
are insufficient when considering roles in the software and web development sector. A custom-built website can not 
only convey the same content, but it can improve its impact and most importantly demonstrate some core skills which 
a potential employer may desire.

The key opportunites were: 
|Opportunity|Importance|Viability/Feasibility|
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
|Create a bespoke online presence|5|5|
|Improve LinkedIn page|5|5|
Increase Recruiter Interaction|4|2|
Standout as a candidate|5|2|
Practice and develop coding skills|5|5|
