# Nick Bowley Resume

## README

## Introduction

---

This site was created as an alternative to a typical Curriculum Vitae. The intent was to also showcase Full Stack Developer skills by creating a product using the skills an employer might disire.

The main objectives of the site are to increase the chances of employment and be a more attractive candidate to potential employers.

## UX

---

It was identified that traditional methods of promoting yourself (CV, Covering Letter, LinkedIn, Application Form)
are insufficient when considering roles in the software and web development sector. A custom-built website can not
only convey the same content, but it can improve its impact and most importantly demonstrate some core skills which
a potential employer may desire.

The key opportunites were:
|Opportunity|Importance|Viability/Feasibility|
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
|Create a bespoke online presence|5|5|
|Improve LinkedIn page|5|5|
Increase Recruiter Interaction|4|2|
Standout as a candidate|5|2|
Practice and develop coding skills|5|5|

## SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
